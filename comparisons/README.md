# Model Comparison Results Documentation

This documentation provides details about a comparison between pyatch models and the Sklearn Linear models, including a metric for comparison and coefficients if found.

## Clone the Project

To reproduce these results, follow these steps to clone the project:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omartarekmoh/ML_From_Scratch
```
### Installing Dependencies

Before running the comparison script, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

- **Scikit-learn**: You can install it via pip:

  ```bash
  pip install scikit-learn
  ```

## Running the Comparison

After cloning the project and installing the dependencies, follow these steps to run the comparison:

This can be used with any model that was made

1. Navigate to the comparisons directory within the project.
2. Run the `*model_name*_comparison.py` script.

Example:

```bash
cd comparisons
python decision_tree_comparison.py
```
