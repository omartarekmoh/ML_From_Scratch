Introduction
This project is designed for educational purposes to help you understand the inner workings of popular machine learning algorithms. By implementing these algorithms from scratch, you will gain a deeper insight into their mechanics, which is often abstracted away by high-level libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

Algorithms Implemented
The following algorithms are currently implemented in this repository:

Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naive Bayes
K-Means Clustering
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Neural Networks
Each algorithm is implemented in its own module with a corresponding example script demonstrating its usage.

Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-algos-from-scratch.git
cd ml-algos-from-scratch
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Each algorithm can be used by importing the respective module. Below is an example of how to use the Linear Regression implementation.

python
Copy code
from algorithms.linear_regression import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Generate some example data
X = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 3]])
y = np.dot(X, np.array([1, 2])) + 3

# Initialize and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X)
print(predictions)
Examples
You can find example scripts for each algorithm in the examples directory. These scripts demonstrate how to use the algorithms on various datasets. To run an example, navigate to the examples directory and execute the script.

bash
Copy code
cd examples
python linear_regression_example.py
