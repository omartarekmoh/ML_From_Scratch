## Introduction

This project is designed for educational purposes to help you understand the inner workings of popular machine learning algorithms. By implementing these algorithms from scratch, you will gain a deeper insight into their mechanics, which is often abstracted away by high-level libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

## Algorithms Implemented

The following algorithms are currently implemented in this repository:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
4. **Decision Tree**
5. **Random Forest**
6. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
7. **Naive Bayes**
8. **K-Means Clustering**
9. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
10. **Neural Networks**

Each algorithm is implemented in its own module with a corresponding example script demonstrating its usage.
